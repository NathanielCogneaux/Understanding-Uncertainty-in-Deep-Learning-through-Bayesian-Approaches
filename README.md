# Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning

This repository serves as a personal workspace to collect and organize thoughts on **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)** in deep learning. If you're interested in UQ, you may find the resources here useful.

## ðŸ“„ PDF Notes

You'll find a PDF titled **"Understanding Uncertainty in Deep Learning through Bayesian Approaches"**, which introduces the basic theoretical foundations of UQ in deep learning. It covers:

* The motivation behind incorporating uncertainty in deep learning
* The mathematical framework of Bayesian approaches
* Key distinctions and categories of uncertainty

## ðŸ§ª Notebooks

Accompanying the PDF are a set of **Jupyter notebooks**, which are fully usable. These notebooks reproduce key images, experiments, and results discussed in the notes. You can run them to better understand the concepts and visualizations presented.

All dependencies can be installed at once using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸŽ¤ Presentation Slides

I've also included a set of slides from a presentation I gave on the research paper:
**"Decomposition of Uncertainty in Bayesian Deep Learning for Efficient and Risk-sensitive Learning"**
by *Stefan Depeweg, JosÃ© Miguel HernÃ¡ndez-Lobato, Finale Doshi-Velez, and Steffen Udluft*.
Available here: [arXiv:1710.07283](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07283)

This paper illustrates practical applications of UQ in **reinforcement learning** and highlights how different types of uncertainty affect learning performance.
